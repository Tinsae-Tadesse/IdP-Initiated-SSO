# üõ°Ô∏è Configuring IdP-Initiated SSO for Keycloak as a SAML 2.0 Identity Broker for OIDC Clients

## üìå Overview

Single Sign-On (SSO) is essential for modern identity and access management. In cases where an organization relies on a centralized SAML-based Identity Provider (IdP) but still wants to authenticate users in OIDC-based applications, **Keycloak** can act as an **identity broker**‚Äîbridging SAML assertions to OIDC clients.

This guide explains how to configure **IdP-Initiated SSO using SAML 2.0**, with Keycloak serving as a SAML proxy that federates authentication to **OIDC clients** behind the scenes.

### ‚úÖ Assumptions

- You have a SAML 2.0-compliant Identity Provider.
- Keycloak is used as the intermediary (identity broker) between the IdP and OIDC applications.
- One or more OIDC clients are already configured in Keycloak (e.g., `oidc-client-a`, `oidc-client-b`).
- You want to enable **IdP-initiated login** and **Single Logout (SLO)**.
- You are using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) as your web server.

## üîß Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. üîó Configure the Identity Provider in Keycloak

This sets up trust between Keycloak and the external SAML IdP.

- Go to **Identity Providers > Add provider > SAML v2.0**.
- Set:
  - **Alias**: `external-saml-idp`.
  - **Import Metadata**: from the IdP‚Äôs metadata URL or XML file.
- Ensure **Single Sign-On Service URL** is populated automatically.
- Set **Single Logout Service URL** for SLO support.
- Enable **Want AuthnRequests Signed**, if required by the IdP.
- Configure attribute mappers for fields like `email`, `username`, etc.

### 2. üß© Create a SAML Proxy Client in Keycloak

This client will act as the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)** endpoint to receive SAML assertions from the IdP.

- Go to **Clients > Create** in the Keycloak admin console.
- Set:
  - **Client ID**: `idpSAMLProxyClient` (or any name).
  - **Client Protocol**: `SAML`.
  - **IdP-Initiated SSO URL Name**: e.g., `idpSAMLProxyClient`.
  - **Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL**: `/sso/oidc-client-a/login` (or any endpoint you‚Äôll use).
  - Enable **Force POST Binding**.
  - Configure signature and encryption settings to match your IdP requirements.

> üí° The `IdP-Initiated SSO URL Name` above is very important in this step, as this URL will become the entry point for IdP-Initiated SSO targeting our OIDC clients. Please note that this should be the URL configured as an assertion consumer endpoint at the external identity provider. 
> Once the value of `IdP-Initiated SSO URL Name` is set, Keycloak exposes a new public URL like this:
```
https://<keycloak-domain>/auth/realms/<realm-name>/broker/<idp-alias>/endpoint/clients/<idp-initiated-sso-url-name>
```
**Example:**
```
https://example.com/auth/realms/my-realm/broker/external-saml-idp/endpoint/clients/idpSAMLProxyClient
```
<br>

> üí° In addition, the `ACS POST Binding URL` above is also very important, as we will use it in [Step 5](#5-%EF%B8%8F-add-apache-httpd-rewrite-rule). If you don't want to set **IdP-Initiated SSO URL Name**, then the default ACS URL that keyclock will provide is the below.

**Default ACS URL (used by Keycloak for SAML assertions):**
```
https://<keycloak-domain>/auth/realms/<realm-name>/broker/<idp-alias>/endpoint
```
**Example:**
```
https://example.com/auth/realms/my-realm/broker/external-saml-idp/endpoint
```

### 3. üß† Customize the First Login Authentication Flow

This ensures correct user provisioning and linking during the first login from the IdP.

- Navigate to **Authentication > Flows > First Broker Login**.
- Click **Copy**, and rename it (e.g., `First Broker Login Flow - IDP`).
- Edit the flow to add or configure:
  - `Create User If Unique` ‚Äì Automatically create users if they don‚Äôt exist.
  - `Handle Existing Account` ‚Äì Prevent duplicate accounts and guide linking.
  - Optional authenticators (based on your needs):
    - `Confirm Link Existing Account` ‚Äì *Disabled* (no user confirmation).
    - `Verify Existing Account By Email` ‚Äì *Disabled*.
    - `Verify Existing Account By Re-authentication` ‚Äì *Disabled*.
    - `Review Profile` ‚Äì *Disabled*.

> üß≠ Apply this custom flow to the IdP under **First Login Flow** in the IdP settings.

---

### 4. üåê Modify the Browser Flow for Seamless Redirection

This forces unauthenticated users to be redirected directly to the IdP.

- Go to **Authentication > Flows > Browser**.
- Click **Copy**, rename to `Browser Flow - IDP`.
- Add the **Identity Provider Redirector** authenticator.
- Set the **Default Identity Provider** to the IdP alias created in [Step 1](#1--configure-the-identity-provider-in-keycloak).
- Go to **Bindings > Browser Flow**, and select your new flow as the default.

---

### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Add Apache HTTPD Rewrite Rule

This rule intercepts SAML assertion POSTs and forwards them to the target OIDC client.

Add the following to your Apache configuration:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST
RewriteRule ^/sso/oidc-client-a/login$ https://oidc-client-a.example.com/ [R=302,L]
```

> üîÅ Adjust the target URL as needed for your specific OIDC client(s).

---

## üß™ Final Verification

- Trigger login from the IdP‚Äôs app launcher.
- Ensure Keycloak accepts and processes the SAML assertion.
- Confirm that users are redirected to the correct OIDC client.
- Verify user provisioning or account linking.
- Test Single Logout (SLO) to ensure proper session termination.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Keycloak simplifies the process of bridging legacy SAML identity systems with modern OIDC applications. By combining SAML proxying, custom authentication flows, and reverse proxy rewrites, you can create a seamless and secure IdP-initiated SSO experience for your users.
